- This tool is still under construction and appears to be a botnet command and control (C2) script. It includes functions for downloading and uploading content, launching UDP and TCP attacks, executing commands, and checking for commands from the C2 server. The script also contains variables for tracking the status of the botnet, including a stop command and a list of leaked IDs. However, this tool appears to be malicious and should not be used.
